# PhDCode

Code I created during my PhD. Uses optimization algorithms on images.

## Local variance

This is code where you can create a subvariety to randomly sample from. With a randomly sampled element you can create a projection matrix and see how well the image retains its shape.

## One dimensional sampling

## Two dimensional sampling

## Sparse Matrix Variety

## Experimental Code
